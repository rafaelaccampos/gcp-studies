As a cloud engineer at Jooli Inc. and recently trained with Google Cloud and Kubernetes, you have been asked to help a new team (Griffin) set up their environment. The team has asked for your help and has done some work, but needs you to complete the work.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks so donâ€™t expect step-by-step guides.

You need to complete the following tasks:

Create a development VPC with three subnets manually
Create a production VPC with three subnets manually
Create a bastion that is connected to both VPCs
Create a development Cloud SQL Instance and connect and prepare the WordPress environment
Create a Kubernetes cluster in the development VPC for WordPress
Prepare the Kubernetes cluster for the WordPress environment
Create a WordPress deployment using the supplied configuration
Enable monitoring of the cluster
Provide access for an additional engineer
